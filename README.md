# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve analyze the performance stocks that premote green energy. We will be looking at data from twelve different green energy stocks over the course of 2017 and 2018, using VBA code to extract data points of interest, such as total volume and yearly return. We will be specifically looking at the performance of the DQ stock (Daqo New Energy Corp) at Steve's request.
## Results
### Stock Performance
For 2017, we can see from our table that all of our green energy stocks had a positive return with the exception of TERP (-7.2%).
