# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve analyze the performance stocks that premote green energy. We will be looking at data from twelve different green energy stocks over the course of 2017 and 2018, using VBA code to extract data points of interest, such as total volume and yearly return. We will be specifically looking at the performance of the DQ stock (Daqo New Energy Corp) at Steve's request.
## Results
### Stock Performance 2017
For 2017, we can see from our table that all of our green energy stocks had a positive return with the exception of TERP (-7.2%).

We can observe that the average return on this portfolio of stocks is 67.3%, so it is safe to say that these green energy stocks did very well in 2017. Our stock of interest, DQ, saw a return of 199.4%, topping the list. 

### Stock Performance 2018
For 2018, it was quite of different story for our green energy stocks. As we can see in our table, there were only two out twelve of our stocks that had a positive return (albeit those stocks did do very well, ENPH and RUN observed a 81.9% and 84% return respectively).
